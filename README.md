# Business-Sales-Analysis-Report
This project is a comprehensive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and visualize business sales data across multiple dimensions including orders, revenue, ratings, categories, dishes, restaurants, and locations. It enables stakeholders to monitor performance, identify growth opportunities, and make data-driven decisions with confidence

# Project Description
### The dashboard provides a multi-layered view of business performance in the food and restaurant industry. It includes:
- Sales Overview: Total revenue, average price, and month-over-month changes.
- Order Analysis: Volume trends, top-performing states, restaurants, and dishes.
- Category Insights: Contribution to sales and orders, rating trends, and growth patterns.
- Dish-Level Performance: Popularity, pricing, customer satisfaction, and behavioral patterns.
- Time-Based Trends: Daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly breakdowns to track seasonality and momentum.
Interactive filters allow users to slice data by state, city, location, week, month, and day of the week.

# Business Insights
## Revenue Concentration Risk
Over 65% of total sales come from the “Recommended” category, indicating a strong reliance on a single product segment. While this drives volume, it also exposes the business to risk if customer preferences shift or if that category underperforms.

## Geographic Disparity in Performance
States like Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh dominate both orders and revenue, while others such as Sikkim, Nagaland, and Mizoram show minimal engagement. This suggests uneven market penetration and untapped regional potential.

## Price-Rating-Order Disconnect
Scatter plot analysis reveals that high-rated dishes often have low order volumes, while frequently ordered items tend to have average or below-average ratings. This indicates that customer satisfaction is not always aligned with popularity is a signal to revisit pricing and promotion strategies.

## Seasonal Volatility
Quarterly trends show a dip in Q3 performance despite consistent growth in Q1 and Q2. This could be due to seasonal factors, operational bottlenecks, or reduced marketing activity. Without intervention, this pattern may repeat annually.

## Restaurant-Level Imbalance
Top restaurants like KFC and McDonald's drive significant sales, while others show negligible performance. This suggests either brand dominance or poor visibility for smaller outlets, which may require rebranding, repositioning, or operational support.

## Customer Feedback Gaps
Some high-selling dishes have very few ratings, limiting the ability to assess customer satisfaction. This gap in feedback can hinder quality control and product improvement efforts.

## Category Saturation vs. Opportunity
Categories like “Desserts” and “Beverages” show moderate sales but consistently low ratings. These segments may be saturated or poorly executed, while emerging categories like “Rolls” and “High-Protein” show promising growth and engagement.


# Business Challenges
## Price-Rating Tradeoff
High-rated dishes often have lower order volumes due to premium pricing, while cheaper items attract more orders but receive lower ratings.

## Category Imbalance
One category (e.g., “Recommended”) dominates sales and orders, creating dependency and limiting diversification.

## Low-Rated Offerings
Several dishes and categories consistently receive poor ratings, which may impact brand perception and repeat business.

## Seasonal Dips in Demand
Q3 shows a noticeable decline in orders and sales, indicating potential seasonal or operational challenges. 

## Underperforming Locations
Certain states and restaurants show consistently low order volumes, suggesting weak market penetration or poor local engagement.

## Customer Feedback Gaps
Some high-selling items have low rating counts, limiting insight into customer satisfaction and improvement areas.

# Strategic Recommendations
## Repackage High-Rated Dishes at Accessible Price Points
Introduce smaller portions or combo deals for premium dishes to improve conversion without compromising quality.

## Diversify Category Promotions
Reduce reliance on the “Recommended” category by spotlighting underutilized segments like “Main Course” or “Desserts” through targeted campaigns.

## Phase Out or Revamp Low-Rated Items
Remove consistently underperforming dishes or improve recipes based on customer feedback to protect brand reputation.

## Launch Seasonal Campaigns in Q3
Counteract seasonal dips with limited-time offers, festive menus, or loyalty rewards to sustain engagement.

## Geo-Targeted Marketing for Low-Performing States
Run localized promotions and partnerships in states like Sikkim, Nagaland, and Mizoram to boost visibility and orders.

## Encourage Ratings Through Incentives
Offer small discounts or loyalty points for customers who leave ratings, especially on high-volume dishes with low feedback.
